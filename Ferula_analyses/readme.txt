In the models_ME directory there are input and output files from the mvSLOUCH analyzes of Ferula data with measurement error included, while in the models_no_ME directory the analyzes of data without measurement error. In each directory, one can find the following files:

- input files: Data_ME.csv (with mesurment error) or Data_no_ME.csv (without measurement error) and tree file in Newick format (Ferula_fruits_tree.txt); the trait names in data files are abbreviated as follows: ration_canals – the proportion of oil ducts covering the space between median and lateral ribs, mean_gr_peri – periderm thickness, wings_area – wing area, thick_wings – wing thickness and seed_mass – seed mass,
- the results for 8 analyzed models (see Fig. 2 in the main text), each in separate directory named model1, model2 and so on,
- each model directory comprises the following files: two R scripts (for analyzes with diagonal and with upper triangular matrix Σyy; each model was run 1000 times), two csv files included information such as number of repetition (i), seed for preliminary analyzes generating starting point (seed_start_point), seed for the main analyses (seed) and AIC, AICc, SIC, BIC, R2 and loglik for each model run (these csv files are sorted according to AICc values), two directories containing results for 1000 analyzes, and two files extracted from these directories showing parameter estimation for the best models (with UpperTri and Diagonal matrix Σyy)

In addition, in the boot directory, there are R scripts, input data and output from bootstrap analyzes of two best models (4 and 7).
