In this directory one may find all the files generated (including the random seeds) during the study of the vascular plant dataset and also R scripts used for this purpose.

To replicate the estimation results one needs to first in each of the folders under the RandomSeed directory (bootstrap, initialdiagUTASR, model1, model2, model3, model4, model5, model6) unzip the zip archives found there. After the random seeds are unpacked one runs source("torun.R"). The file usercontrolledvariables.R contains a number of R variables that allow the user to control the analyses. In order to replicate the results the logical variable b_use_random_seed_from_manuscript has to be set to TRUE. If not, then the simulations will start from those provided by R .Random.seed. If furthermore b_should_random_seed_be_saved is TRUE, then the random number generator seeds will be saved (hence a combination of FALSE and TRUE respectively will lead to overwriting whatever random number generator seeds are stored). The integer variable num_cores is the number of CPU cores to be used in the parallalization.
