Fast_mvSLOUCH_example.zip contains the script (Fast_mvSLOUCH_example.R), alongside the inputs (within the INPUTS folder) 
and outputs for the large plant dataset analysed in the paper.

1. After extraction of the zip folder from github, place the folder where you seek to perform analyses.

2. Set the working directory to this folder - setwd()

3. Open the Fast_mvSLOUCH_example.R script in R

4. If you want to run everything again (it will take at least 2 weeks using 6 cores on a laptop), set
runtype <- "novel.run"
at the top of the code. This will overwrite any outputs already in the folder, only drawing data from
the INPUTS folder. You may find it easier therefore, to delete or move all files and folders except for
the INPUTS FOLDER and this script.

5. If you wish to run the code without fitting the models, but by loading our model outputs as presented in the paper, set:
runtype <- "load.previous.outputs"
This will enable you to examine our outputs within R.
